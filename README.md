# Project-2 Fraud Detection System
#### Link to repo https://github.com/eliza0101/Project-2.git  
#### Link to presentation:
Develop a ML model to solve, analyze, or visualize a problem

## Overview

## Dependencies
* Pandas
* Matplotlib 
* seaborn
* sklearn


## Datasets (Eliza)
#### File location: Movie_Datasets
We will be using the datasets from: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/data
1. train_identity.csv
2. tran_transaction.csv

## Data Preparation and Cleaning (Eliza) 
#### File location: project_2_data cleaning.ipynb
* Merge both datasets into one dataframe
* Clean data and remove colomns with more than 10% missing values
* Handle non-numeric data
* Create new csv for merged and cleaned files

## Exploratory Data Analysis (Eliza) 
#### File location: project_2_main.ipynb
* Missing Values Analysis
* Numerical Data Analysis
* Visualize class distribution
* Categorical Data Analysis
* Correlation Analysis

## Model Development (Tunji)
* Train Logistic Regression
* Train Random Forest Classifier
* Top Features Selection
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC Curve

## Model Optimization and Reporting (Will)
* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Best Parameters and Score
* Line Plot of ROC AUC Scores
* Summary Chart

## Notes
The datafiles.zip needs to be unzipped before running the cleaning notebook.
